  <h3>3D Modeling - Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    3D Modeling is a form of computer graphics used to create models assisted with technology. It can be used to model houses, toys, tools, plastic parts, or anything the designer desires. I think the most challenging part about this unit for me was the mdoeling of the catapult. I found it annoying and cumbersome, and I am not quite satisfied with my end product. It's fine, but it could have been much better. I think my favorite part was the SketchUp Modeling because it was pretty easy and I enjoyed working with SketchUp.
