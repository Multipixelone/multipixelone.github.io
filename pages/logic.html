  <h3 id="Binary">Binary</h3>
  <p>This is most often used in binary, a counting system derived from base 2. In binary, numbers can be expressed with only two different digits. The most common amount of digits used is 8 in a row. When there are 8 binary characters next to each other, it is referred to as a byte. Using base 10, each place value would be worth a factor of 10. Base 2 is similar but with factors of two. The first place is worth 1, the second place is worth 2, the third place is worth 4, the fourth place is worth 8, and so on and so on. The highest number you can make with 8 bits is 255</p>

  <h3 id="ASCII">ASCII & Unicode - A Brief History</h3>
  <p>In the beginning, there was ASCII. A simple table that would take a number produced by binary and convert it into an English letter or code. The problem with ASCII was it only used 8 bits to contain the information. Each country made their own conversion table that could convert numbers into their own language. The problem was there was no consistancy, you couldn't send a message to your friend with a phone from a differet country and have it appear the same. Unicode came along and was a fix for that. With 16 bits, they had room for every character from every modern language, and room to spare. In Unicode with 16 bits, they have room for 65,536 different characters. This made it so each device could communicate human readable information in the same way</p>
